                  The vision of <strong>Weboum Technology</strong> is
                  domain-centric, end-to-end technology, innovative, trusted,
                  supportive, and high-quality web solutions which consider us

                <ul className="principles-list">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Integrity</strong> – Honesty in how we deal with our
                    clients, each other, and with the world.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Candor</strong> – Be open and upfront in all our
                    conversations. Keep clients updated on the real situation.
                    Deal with situations early; avoid last-minute surprises.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Service</strong> – Seek to empower and enable our
                    clients. Consider ourselves successful not when we deliver
                    our client&apos;s final product but when the product is
                    launched and meets success.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Kindness</strong> – Go the extra mile. Speak the
                    truth with grace. Deliver more than is expected or promised.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Competence</strong> – Benchmark with the best in the
                    business. Try new and better things. Never rest on laurels.
                    Move out of comfort zones. Keep suggesting new things. Seek
                    to know more.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Growth</strong> – Success is a journey, not a
                    destination. Seek to multiply/increase what we have –
                    wealth, skills, influence, and our client&apos;s business.
